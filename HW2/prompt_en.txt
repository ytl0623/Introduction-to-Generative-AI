Example Essay1 (Bad):
“Artificial intelligence is bad. It will replace humans in the future. This is not good. We need jobs. Robots are not good. They will take our jobs. We need jobs to live. That is why I disagree.”

Example Essay 2 (Average):
“Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more prevalent in today’s world. Its capabilities, like analyzing large data sets and automating repetitive tasks, make it a valuable asset in many industries. For instance, in healthcare, AI assists in diagnosing diseases with higher accuracy. However, its integration into the workforce raises concerns about job displacement.
Despite these advancements, AI lacks certain human qualities. It cannot replicate human empathy or creativity, which are crucial in professions like teaching or artistic endeavors. These roles require an understanding of human emotions and experiences that AI cannot provide. Therefore, while AI can support these fields, it cannot entirely replace the human element.
In conclusion, while AI’s role is expanding, it is unlikely to completely replace humans in all job sectors. The balance between AI efficiency and human empathy is essential. Future advancements should focus on AI assisting humans, not replacing them, ensuring a harmonious coexistence between technology and humanity.”
